	<h1>Current</h1>
	<p>Quick progress is underway for <a href="/blastula/index.html">a unique and novel shmup/STG framework in the Godot game engine.</a> This project is known as <b>Blastula</b> because it has &quot;blast&quot; in the name, and because it is the embryo from which such games can share an ontogeny. The gimmick of this framework is a modular APL-inspired pattern construction system, and a bullet hierarchy organization to complement it. It also uses &quot;unsafe&quot; C#, controlled multithreading, and various other tricks for high performance.</p>
	<p>An additional dependent add-on for Blastula, known as <b>HellSyncer</b>, has also been produced. The add-on makes it easy to sync bullet barrages with music by waiting for beats or notes to occur. It relies on parsing select tracks of a MIDI file to obtain its beat and note info, but even if you don't have a MIDI, a simple one can be generated from a tempo and time signature.</p>
